      "---------------------\n"
      "\n"
      "    * If the bug is in Subversion itself, send mail to\n"
      "      users@subversion.tigris.org. Once it's confirmed as a bug,\n"
      "      someone, possibly you, can enter it into the issue tracker. (Or\n"
      "      if you're pretty sure about the bug, go ahead and post directly\n"
      "      to our development list, dev@subversion.tigris.org. But if\n"
      "      you're not sure, it's better to post to users@ first; someone\n"
      "      there can tell you whether the behavior you encountered is\n"
      "      expected or not.)\n"
      "\n"
      "    * If the bug is in the APR library, please report it to both of\n"
      "      these mailing lists: dev@apr.apache.org, dev@subversion.tigris.org.\n"
      "\n"
      "    * If the bug is in the Neon HTTP library, please report it to:\n"

      "\n"
      "    * If the bug is in Apache HTTPD 2.0, please report it to both of\n"
      "      these mailing lists: dev@httpd.apache.org,\n"
      "      dev@subversion.tigris.org. The Apache httpd developer mailing\n"
      "      list is high-traffic, so your bug report post has the\n"
      "      possibility to be overlooked. You may also file a bug report at\n"

      "How To Report A Bug\n"
      "-------------------\n"
      "\n"
      "First, make sure it's a bug. If Subversion does not behave the way you\n"
      "expect, look in the documentation and mailing list archives for\n"
      "evidence that it should behave the way you expect. Of course, if it's\n"
      "a common-sense thing, like Subversion just destroyed your data and\n"
      "caused smoke to pour out of your monitor, then you can trust your\n"
      "judgement. But if you're not sure, go ahead and ask on the users\n"
      "mailing list first, users@subversion.tigris.org, or ask in IRC,\n"
      "irc.freenode.net, channel #svn.\n"
      "\n"
      "Once you've established that it's a bug, the most important thing you\n"
      "can do is come up with a simple description and reproduction\n"
      "recipe. For example, if the bug, as you initially found it, involves\n"
      "five files over ten commits, try to make it happen with just one file\n"
      "and one commit. The simpler the reproduction recipe, the more likely a\n"
      "developer is to successfully reproduce the bug and fix it.\n"
      "\n"
      "When you write up the reproduction recipe, don't just write a prose\n"
      "description of what you did to make the bug happen. Instead, give a\n"
      "literal transcript of the exact series of commands you ran, and their\n"
      "output. Use cut-and-paste to do this. If there are files involved, be\n"
      "sure to include the names of the files, and even their content if you\n"
      "think it might be relevant. The very best thing is to package your\n"
      "reproduction recipe as a script, that helps us a lot.\n"
      "\n"
      "<emphasis>Quick sanity check: you *are* running the most recent version of\n"
      "Subversion, right? :-) Possibly the bug has already been fixed; you\n"
      "should test your reproduction recipe against the most recent\n"
      "Subversion development tree.</emphasis>\n"
      "\n"
      "In addition to the reproduction recipe, we'll also need a complete\n"
      "description of the environment in which you reproduced the bug. That\n"
      "means:\n"
      "\n"
      "    * Your operating system\n"
      "    * The release and/or revision of Subversion\n"
      "    * The compiler and configuration options you built Subversion with\n"
      "    * Any private modifications you made to your Subversion\n"
      "    * The version of Berkeley DB you're running Subversion with, if any\n"
      "    * Anything else that could possibly be relevant. Err on the side\n"
      "      of too much information, rather than too little.\n"
      "\n"
      "Once you have all this, you're ready to write the report. Start out\n"
      "with a clear description of what the bug is. That is, say how you\n"
      "expected Subversion to behave, and contrast that with how it actually\n"
      "behaved. While the bug may seem obvious to you, it may not be so\n"
      "obvious to someone else, so it's best to avoid a guessing game. Follow\n"
      "that with the environment description, and the reproduction recipe. If\n"
      "you also want to include speculation as to the cause, and even a patch\n"
      "to fix the bug, that's great — see\n"
      "http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/www/hacking.html#patches for\n"
      "instructions on sending patches.\n"
      "\n"
      "Post all of this information to dev@subversion.tigris.org, or if you\n"
      "have already been there and been asked to file an issue, then go to\n"
      "the Issue Tracker and follow the instructions there.\n"
      "\n"
      "Thanks. We know it's a lot of work to file an effective bug report,\n"
      "but a good report can save hours of a developer's time, and make the\n"
      "bug much more likely to get fixed."
