      "My last pamphlet was sufficiently well received that I was not\n"
      "scared away from sending another one, and today I have the time\n"
      "and inclination to do so.\n"
      "\n"
      "I've had a little trouble with deciding on the right distribution\n"
      "of this kind of stuff, this time it is bcc'ed to committers and\n"
      "hackers, that is probably the best I can do.  I'm not subscribed\n"
      "to hackers myself but more on that later.\n"
      "\n"
      "The thing which have triggered me this time is the \"sleep(1) should\n"
      "do fractional seconds\" thread, which have pestered our lives for\n"
      "many days now, it's probably already a couple of weeks, I can't\n"

      "\n"
      "To those of you who have missed this particular thread: Congratulations.\n"
      "\n"
      "It was a proposal to make sleep(1) DTRT if given a non-integer\n"
      "argument that set this particular grass-fire off.  I'm not going\n"
      "to say anymore about it than that, because it is a much smaller\n"
      "item than one would expect from the length of the thread, and it\n"
      "has already received far more attention than some of the *problems*\n"
      "we have around here.\n"
      "\n"
      "The sleep(1) saga is the most blatant example of a bike shed\n"
      "discussion we have had ever in FreeBSD.  The proposal was well\n"
      "thought out, we would gain compatibility with OpenBSD and NetBSD,\n"
      "and still be fully compatible with any code anyone ever wrote.\n"
      "\n"
      "Yet so many objections, proposals and changes were raised and\n"
      "launched that one would think the change would have plugged all\n"
      "the holes in swiss cheese or changed the taste of Coca Cola or\n"
      "something similar serious.\n"
      "\n"
      "\"What is it about this bike shed ?\" Some of you have asked me.\n"
      "\n"
      "It's a long story, or rather it's an old story, but it is quite\n"
      "short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early\n"
      "1960'ies, called \"Parkinson's Law\", which contains a lot of insight\n"
      "into the dynamics of management.\n"
      "\n"
      "You can find it on Amazon, and maybe also in your dads book-shelf,\n"
      "it is well worth its price and the time to read it either way,\n"
      "if you like Dilbert, you'll like Parkinson.\n"
      "\n"
      "Somebody recently told me that he had read it and found that only\n"
      "about 50% of it applied these days.  That is pretty darn good I\n"
      "would say, many of the modern management books have hit-rates a\n"
      "lot lower than that, and this one is 35+ years old.\n"
      "\n"
      "In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital\n"
      "component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the\n"
      "age of the book.\n"
      "\n"
      "Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and\n"
      "get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar\n"
      "atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will\n"
      "be tangled up in endless discussions.\n"
      "\n"
      "Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so vast,\n"
      "so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and\n"
      "rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody\n"
      "else checked all the details before it got this far.   Richard P.\n"
      "Feynmann gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point,\n"
      "examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.\n"
      "\n"
      "A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one of those over\n"
      "a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV.  So no\n"
      "matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with\n"
      "your proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is\n"
      "doing his job, that he is paying attention, that he is *here*.\n"
      "\n"
      "In Denmark we call it \"setting your fingerprint\".  It is about\n"
      "personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point\n"
      "somewhere and say \"There!  *I* did that.\"  It is a strong trait in\n"
      "politicians, but present in most people given the chance.  Just\n"
      "think about footsteps in wet cement.\n"
      "\n"
      "I bow my head in respect to the original proposer because he stuck\n"
      "to his guns through this carpet blanking from the peanut gallery,\n"
      "and the change is in our tree today.  I would have turned my back\n"
      "and walked away after less than a handful of messages in that\n"
      "thread.\n"
      "\n"
      "And that brings me, as I promised earlier, to why I am not subscribed\n"
      "to -hackers:\n"
      "\n"
      "I un-subscribed from -hackers several years ago, because I could\n"
      "not keep up with the email load.  Since then I have dropped off\n"
      "several other lists as well for the very same reason.\n"
      "\n"
      "And I still get a lot of email.  A lot of it gets routed to /dev/null\n"
      "by filters:  People like [omitted] will never make it onto my\n"
      "screen, commits to documents in languages I don't understand\n"
      "likewise, commits to ports as such.  All these things and more go\n"
      "the winter way without me ever even knowing about it.\n"
      "\n"
      "But despite these sharp teeth under my mailbox I still get too much\n"
      "email.\n"
      "\n"
      "This is where the greener grass comes into the picture:\n"
      "\n"
      "I wish we could reduce the amount of noise in our lists and I wish\n"
      "we could let people build a bike shed every so often, and I don't\n"
      "really care what colour they paint it.\n"
      "\n"
      "The first of these wishes is about being civil, sensitive and \n"
      "intelligent in our use of email.\n"

      "when one should and when one should not reply to an email so that\n"
      "everybody would agree and abide by it, I would be a happy man, but\n"
